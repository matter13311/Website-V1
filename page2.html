    <h1 align="center"><strong>Personal statement and Goals</strong></h1>
    <p class = "writing">Ever since I was exposed to coding, I knew I wanted to continue coding but I did not know in what field. I did not know if I should pursue computer science and work on databases or if I should be a website developer. After spending some time in my CSCI major, I realized that I wanted to pursue being a web developer. I love the creativity you can apply to websites and all the unique functions that can be implemented using Javascript. From this class, I wish to expand my knowledge in web development and design. I know the basics of web development but I never had any stepping stones to help motivate me and help me further learn about web development. I also did not have a foundation for web design. I know whether a website looks professional and appealing to the eye, but I do not know what details make it look professional. I would like to further expand my knowledge in web design and how to make a website more appealing to viewers, as well as expand my knowledge in Javascript so I can make fun, interactive websites that has many functions.</p>
